## {{ page.title }}

I am a software developer with a Bachelor of Information Technology - Games design and development.   I work in .NET development in Melbourne, Australia.

On this website, I plan to document the programming challenges I face, hoping to have something to refer back to if I ever hit the same problems again.  As a bonus maybe someone else will find an answer they have been seeking, or be able to provide some additional insight.

You can find my public work on [Github](https://github.com/Kellamity), private work on [Visual Studio Online](https://kellylynstarr.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_projects) and more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-starr-253373aa/).
